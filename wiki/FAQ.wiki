===FAQ===

*Does my system support the USB cable?*

run the following command in your konsole:
{{{
lsusb
}}}
You should see a entry like this:
Bus 002 Device 002: ID 067b:2303 Prolific Technology, Inc. PL2303 Serial Port

Then your USB cable should be supported from your system



*Does my system receive data from my currentcost device?*

run the following command in your konsole:
{{{
sudo cat /dev/ttyUSB0
}}}

You should now see the xml data stream
Press ctrl+c to get back control of the konsole



*I receive no data although the system supports the USB cable*

You can try to load the USB driver again. Do this with the following command.

{{{
sudo modprobe -r pl2303
sudo modprobe pl2303
}}}

The baud rate from the the USB interface should be 57600. Set this with the following command. Yes 2 times ;)
{{{
sudo stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 57600
sudo stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 57600
}}}


*I install a system into a virtual machine software. I do not found the /dev/ttyUSB0 device*

I do not have any experience with virtual systems. However... If the device is a serial port in your linux guest you will find it under /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1, /dev/ttyS2 ,....

I take a look in google and found a very good instruction page how to get the device into virtual machine. Thanks to the author!  :)
