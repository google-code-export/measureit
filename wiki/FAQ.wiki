===FAQ===

*Does my system support the USB cable?*

Plug in the cable and run the following command in your konsole:
{{{
lsusb
}}}
You should see a entry like this:
Bus 002 Device 002: ID 067b:2303 Prolific Technology, Inc. PL2303 Serial Port

Then your USB cable should be supported from your system

On windows systems please read the information from the currentcost website



*Does my system receive data from my currentcost device?*

Measureit writes infos into a logfile. There you can see error messages or debug informations.

{{{
tail -f /tmp/measureit.log
}}}

To get detailed informations to debug you can start the grabber manually. 

This will write a lot of debugging information in the measure.log
{{{
/usr/bin/python /usr/local/measureit/python/data-input.py test
}}}

To create a log file from the XML Output from your Current Cost device you can do the following.

This will write the original XML into the file /tmp/mylogfile.txt
{{{
/usr/bin/python /usr/local/measureit/python/data-input.py test > /tmp/mylogfile.txt
}}}

You should now see the xml data stream and in the log are detailed informations.
Press ctrl+c to get back control of the konsole

On windows systems you can use the "C2 Terminal" software from currentcost.


*I receive no data although the system supports the USB cable*

You can try to load the USB driver again. Do this with the following command.

{{{
sudo modprobe -r pl2303
sudo modprobe pl2303
}}}

The baud rate from the the USB interface should be 57600. Set this with the following command. Yes 2 times ;)
{{{
sudo stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 57600
sudo stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 57600
}}}


*I receive the XML data but nothing was displayed on the website*

Control that your appliance id is the same like the sensor id in measureit. You will find the appliance id in the right bottom corner ( Envi ). See the instructions from the currentcost website how to pair a device. [http://currentcost.com/product-envi-installation.html Here you will find the installation from the envi]

In the xml data you will find the device id from your transmitter and how it is paired with your currentcost device. There you find something like this:

{{{<msg><src>CCdsb>00385</dsb><timemsg><src>CC128-v0.12</srtime>06:52:19</time><tmpr>20.3</tmpr><sensor>1</sensor><id>01674</id><type>1</type><ch1><watts>00236</watts></ch1></msg>}}}

{{{<sensor>1</sensor>}}}


In this example make sure that your sensor has id 1. The start screen from the envi is sensor 0.


*I install a system into a virtual machine software. I do not found the /dev/ttyUSB0 device*

I do not have any experience with virtual systems. However... If the device is a serial port in your linux guest you will find it under /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1, /dev/ttyS2 ,....

On Windows systems it is the com3 device.

I take a look in google and found a very good instruction page how to get the device into virtual machine. Thanks to the author!  :)

*I get a white screen after installing*

If you get a white page with no information after installing or update there is mostly an error in your config. 

Try the following steps:

  * There are 2 files that include your database settings. The one that is responsible for white pages is php/class.db.php. Make shure the database settings (user, pass, host...) are correct. You can call the follwing URL to get a clear error message: <code>http://YOUR-CURRENT_URL/php/measureit_functions.php?do=navigation_main</code>

  * I do a programming error so your second step should be [https://code.google.com/p/measureit/issues/detail?id=17 to take a look here]

  * If there is no solution please create a new [http://code.google.com/p/measureit/issues/list issue]

*Security*

I believe that the most of you will use measureit with a public dyndns domain. There is no problem with this idea but note that everyone who knows this domain or find it with a search engine can add sensor or sensor positions or if this is a evil person can *delete all your data*!

To make shure that this is not happend open the file php/measureit_functions.php with a text editor and replace the following line at the beginning of the script:

replace

{{{$demo = false;}}}

with

{{{$demo = true;}}}


After changing this line it is not possible to do the following actions:

see/download/create/delete backups, add/delete sensors, add/delete sensor positions


Change the mysql password!

The setup from measureit set a default password with the value "measureitpasswd". If you decide to make measureit available in the internet you *MUST* change it. Replace the XXXXXXXXXXXXXX with your new password. If you use windows and the xammp server you can change the password from the mysql user in phpMyAdmin. You will find it in the user rights settings.

{{{
mysql -uroot -p
use mysql;
update user set Password = password('XXXXXXXXXXXXXX') where User = 'measureit';
flush privileges;
}}}

Then edit /usr/local/measureit/measureit.cfg.php and change the password
{{{
$database_passwd                 = "measureitpasswd";
$database_passwd                = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
}}}

You had to restart the grabber

*Does measureit supports multiple clambs per sensor?*

Since version 112 you will have clamp support. 
*Thanks to Ivo from Switzerland*. He is the gui who sponsored the clamps for developing.

*How can I stop the python grabber?*

On windows machines it should be enough to close the cmd window or shut down the service if measureit runs as a service. On unix / linux machines you must kill the process. 

Find the ProcessID
{{{
ps auxf | grep data-input
}}}

You will get something like this

root      3959  2.5  2.0  48988  9176 ?        Sl   Feb11  91:56 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/measureit/python/data-input.py

In this case The PID is 3959

{{{
kill -9 3959
}}}

If you are running measureit under supervise shut down the process with
{{{
svc -d /service/measureit
}}}

To start it again
{{{
svc -u /service/measureit
}}}

*Does measureit supports IAMS (Individial Appliance Monitor)?*

Yes. IAMs are the same like a sensor. Pair your IAM with your Envi and add a sensor in the admin menu from measureit. Then restart the grabber.

*Measureit does not work with Internet Explorer version X*

The Internet Explorer is a bug and not a browser. I do not waste any private lifetime to get things working with IE. Measureit works with Safari, Firefox, Chrome and Opera.
