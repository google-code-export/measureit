===FAQ===

*Does my system support the USB cable?*

Plug in the cable and run the following command in your konsole:
{{{
lsusb
}}}
You should see a entry like this:
Bus 002 Device 002: ID 067b:2303 Prolific Technology, Inc. PL2303 Serial Port

Then your USB cable should be supported from your system



*Does my system receive data from my currentcost device?*

run the following command in your konsole:
{{{
sudo cat /dev/ttyUSB0
}}}

You should now see the xml data stream
Press ctrl+c to get back control of the konsole



*I receive no data although the system supports the USB cable*

You can try to load the USB driver again. Do this with the following command.

{{{
sudo modprobe -r pl2303
sudo modprobe pl2303
}}}

The baud rate from the the USB interface should be 57600. Set this with the following command. Yes 2 times ;)
{{{
sudo stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 57600
sudo stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 57600
}}}


*I receive the XML data but nothing was displayed on the website*

If you have only 1 transmitter from currentcost make sure to to pair it with the "Appliance 1" display. You reach it by press the up/down button on your currentcost device. You will find the appliance id in the right bottom corner ( Envi ). See the instructions from the currentcost website how to pair a device. [http://currentcost.com/product-envi-installation.html Here you will find the installation from the envi]

In the xml data you will find the device id your transmitter is paired with your currentcost device. There you find something like this:

{{{<msg><src>CCdsb>00385</dsb><timemsg><src>CC128-v0.12</srtime>06:52:19</time><tmpr>20.3</tmpr><sensor>2</sensor><id>01674</id><type>1</type><ch1><watts>00236</watts></ch1></msg>}}}

Make sure that your sensor has id 1. The start screen from the envi is sensor 0.

{{{<sensor>1</sensor>}}}

Measureit does not consider any data from sensor 0


*I install a system into a virtual machine software. I do not found the /dev/ttyUSB0 device*

I do not have any experience with virtual systems. However... If the device is a serial port in your linux guest you will find it under /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1, /dev/ttyS2 ,....

On Windows systems it is the com3 device.

I take a look in google and found a very good instruction page how to get the device into virtual machine. Thanks to the author!  :)

*Security*

I believe that the most of you will use measureit with a public dyndns domain. There is no problem with this idea but note that everyone who knows this domain or find it with a search engine can add sensor or sensor positions or if this is a evil person can *delete all your data*!

To make shure that this is not happend open the file php/measureit_functions.php with a text editor and replace the following line at the beginning of the script:

replace

{{{$demo = false;}}}

with

{{{$demo = true;}}}


After changing this line it is not possible to do the following actions:

see/download/create/delete backups, add/delete sensors, add/delete sensor positions


Change the mysql password!

The setup from measureit set a default password with the value "measureitpasswd". If you decide to make measureit available in the internet you *MUST* change it. Replace the XXXXXXXXXXXXXX with your new password. If you use windows and the xammp server you can change the password from the mysql user in phpMyAdmin. You will find it in the user rights settings.

{{{
mysql -uroot -p
use mysql;
update user set Password = password('XXXXXXXXXXXXXX') where User = 'measureit';
flush privileges;
}}}

Then edit php/class.db.php and change the password
{{{
var $pass                 = "measureitpasswd";
var $pass                 = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
}}}

*Does measureit supports multiple clambs per sensor?*

Currently not. I use no clambs because of I do not have an usecase. 
There where some requests to add this feature. It is possible to add this feature so I decide to start a wishlist on Amazon. If you are very interested to get this feature feel free to make me 1 or more clambs as a gift. When I has some clambs I will try to find a usecase and start programming..   :)

I put some articles on this list to make more usecases available as they are requested. Things like multiple base stations and much more.

*Measureit does not work with Internet Explorer version X*

The Internet Explorer is a bug and not a browser. I do not waste any private lifetime to get things working with IE. Measureit works with Safari, Firefox, Chrome and Opera.
