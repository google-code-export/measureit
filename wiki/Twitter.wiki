*Twitter*

You can connect your measureit to twitter. For this you will need a twitter account and a developer account with it. That is not my idea it is the regulation from twitter. But no panic I will try to explain it as easy as possible :D

DO NOT use you current twitter account. Create a new one if you do not want to loose all of your follower because of testing with alerts...

After creating and confirm you email log in dev.twitter.com with the new account
https://dev.twitter.com

On the right upper corner you find a drop down. Click "My applications "

You will found a empty list with the option to create a application.

Choose name, description, url (can be http://127.0.0.1) and save the new application. Leave callback url empty.

You are now in the settings from your new app if all data are correct while creating it.

Change to the "Settings" tab and change "Application Type" to "Read, Write and Access direct messages". click "Update this twitter applications settings"
