#labels linux,Phase-Deploy,setup,install
*PLEASE NOTE:*

This are the install instructions from measureit version 112 that will be released in July 2012. Please be patient and do not install version 111. The update process is not really user friendly for people without linux skills :)

Feel free to install a running linux system meanwhile.

Thank you.

----

== Install on a already running Linux ==

The data cable driver you need is available since kernel version 2.6.30

*If you have already a running Linux test if your kernel support the data cable:*

If you have a older kernel then you had to upgrade to a newer version. 
The kernel you use you can find out with:

{{{uname -a}}}

You will need:
a webserver ( apache, lighttpd, nginx, etc )
mysql database server ( version > 5 )
php5

All further informations you will found below


Known issues and solutions when you are running into problems during the setup you will find on the [http://code.google.com/p/measureit/wiki/FAQ faq page] in the wiki

==Starting with a new system:==

Debian Lenny / Squeeze does not work with the data cable so I use a [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu Desktop Version] that is easy to install.
After downloading and install you have a ready to use linux system.
Open "Konsole". You will find it under applications.

If you get the data cable working on a debian system feel free to tell me how :)

Copy and paste every from the following lines into the konsole and press enter. During the installation you will asked for a password for the database user root. Remember this password!

{{{
sudo apt-get install php5-cgi php5-cli apache2 mysql-server libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mysql
}}}

Now all required software is installed. 

Next we download and setup Measureit. You will asked for the user password you entered during the setup from Ubuntu. Replace the XXX with the current version. The newest you will find in the downloads

{{{
cd /usr/local/src
sudo wget http://measureit.googlecode.com/files/measureit-XXX.tgz
sudo tar -zxvf measureit-XXX.tgz
cd measureit-XXX
}}}

create measureit start script

{{{
sudo cp install/measureit_init_script.txt /etc/init.d/measureit
sudo update-rc.d measureit defaults
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/measureit
}}}

setup the database. You will asked for the database root password you hopefully remember :)

{{{
sudo cat install/createdb.sql | mysql -uroot -p
}}}

remove the install directory

{{{
sudo rm -R ./install
}}}

remove the scripts directory if you are not plan to use one of them. If you plan to use one of the scripts do not forget to delete this directory after using.

{{{
sudo rm -R ./scripts
}}}

copy the Measureit code to the webserver directory and give the webserver the rights to read and write the directory

{{{
sudo cp -fr ./* /var/www
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www
sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www
}}}

The grabber script is written in python. It is working on windows and on linux. Python and the necessary modules should be installed on the most linux operating systems. On Ubuntu I need to install the mysql module. 

{{{
sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb
}}}

If you get error messages from python about missing modules you had to install these. Modules used by measureit are:
{{{
serial
re
MySQLdb
datetime
warnings
time
threading
sys
platform
}}}

start grabbing the data

{{{
sudo /etc/init.d/measureit start
}}}

You are done!
Open your Browser an type in localhost. You can see the start page. Go to the tab Setup and change the data from the sensor or add additional sensors. Have a lot of fun :)
