== Install on a already running Linux ==

The data cable driver you need is only available since kernel version 2.6.30

*If you have already a running Linux test if your kernel support the data cable:*

If you have a a hen you had to upgrade to a newer version. 
The kernel you use you can find out with:

{{{uname -a}}}

=Important Please Note=

Some users told me problems with installing. I try to find out the problems. No I know a lot of them...

*In my experience the new ubuntu 11.4 is not ideal for non computer experts to install and run measureit...*


I will do some more experience with some other linux distributions after my holiday :)

Sorry for waiting time. I will be back on 2011.06.20


But for now I need my holiday ;)


If you are not practiced with linux systems stop here now and be patient with me. I will deliver a better solution!


==Starting with a new system:==

Debian Lenny has no driver support to the data cable so I use a [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu Desktop Version] that is easy to install.
After downloading and install you have a ready to use linux system.
Open "Konsole". You will find it under applications.

Copy and paste every from the following lines into the konsole and press enter. During the installation you will asked for a password for the database user root. Remember this password!
{{{
sudo apt-get install php5-cgi php5-cli apache2 mysql-server libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mysql
}}}

Now all required software is installed. 

Next we download and setup Measureit. You will asked for the user password you entered during the setup from Ubuntu. Replace the XXX with the current version. The newest you will find in the downloads

{{{
cd /usr/local/src
sudo wget http://measureit.googlecode.com/files/measureit-XXX.tgz
sudo tar -zxvf measureit-XXX.tgz
cd measureit-XXX
}}}

start Measureit with system start

{{{
sudo cp install/measureit_init_script.txt /etc/init.d/measureit
sudo update-rc.d measureit defaults
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/measureit
}}}

setup the database. You will asked for the database root password you hopefully remember :)

{{{
sudo cat install/createdb.sql | mysql -uroot -p
}}}

copy the Measureit code to the webserver directory

{{{
sudo cp -fr ./* /var/www
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www
}}}

start grabbing the data

{{{
sudo /etc/init.d/measureit start
}}}

You are done!
Use the Firefox Browser an type in localhost. You can see the start page. Go to the tab Setup and change the data from the sensor or add additional sensors. Have a lot of fun :)
