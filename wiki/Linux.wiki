== Install on Linux ==

The data cable driver you need is only available since kernel version 2.6.30

*If you have already a running Linux test if your kernel support the data cable:*

{{{lsusb -v -d 067b:2303 | grep bMaxPacketSize0}}}

if the result is

{{{bMaxPacketSize0        64}}}

your kernel DOES NOT support the data cable. 
Then you had to upgrade to a newer version. 
The kernel you use you can find out with:

{{{uname -a}}}

*If you a starting with a new system:*

Debian Lenny has no driver support to the data cable so I use a [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu Desktop Version] that is easy to install.


This following code examples are for a new installed ubuntu.

If you have a support driver you need also:
 * a Mysql Database Server
 * a running webserver (f.e. Apache or lighttpd)
 * PHP ( tested under PHP 5 )

{{{sudo apt-get install php5-cgi php5-cli apache2 sshd ssh mysql5 mysql-server libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mysql}}}

will install all software you need. Follow the instructions from the mysql installer.

*cut  next time I complete the install instructions :)*
