=Api Documentation=

To use the data from measureit in other applications there is a option to make requests that delivers data in JSON format. Some older options that are not ported to JSON already delivers a javascript object that is used in the graphs. They include a timestamp in JS milliseconds ( timestamp+000 ) and the data.

This documentation shows currently only the option to receive data. Currently I do not see a sense to describe the options to change / save settings.

The request URL is always http://YOUR-MEASUREIT-IP/php/measureit_functions.php

You had to send the parameter do with the wanted action. The action name is mostly practical. 

Format: measureit_functions.php?do=do_something

The sensors with ID > 10 are the clamps. Sensor 21 is Sensor 2 Clamp 1.

To receive settings data like usernames, passwords or api keys from a sensor the demo parameter at the beginning of the measureit_functions.php had to be false. Otherwise the values are always empty.

$demo = false; 

Changeable parameters are always marked. If you change a time period parameter to a higher value you had to make sure that there is no timeout from php. In the measureit Pi images the timeout is set to 30 seconds.
